# it's entry two!

I will keep it brief today :). I woke up quite late but managed to get stuff done anyway:
- Finish portfolio submissions
- Applied for a job (*gasp*)
- Played a ton of Silksong, hence this post's theme (no spoilers but pogo'd many flowers (?) today in Hunter's March. Also beat a boss and had a really good experience with it, beautiful fight! Just wish it was a little harder or lasted a little longer...)
- Drove around (another gasp. I'm getting my license soon! I personally don't know how I'm even allowed on the streets in the first place maneuvering a 1.5 ton killing machine, but you know. The world is a strange place.)
- and other stuff I'm probably missing. At some point in the day, I stood outside with my dog, breathed, and looked up at the sky.

Tomorrow is a day of science^TM, because I have a lot of nerdy things I need to get done. But today was a really nice day even though I left lots of tasks for tomorrow. There's something about the blue sky + cold weather that just does it for me. I stood there thinking about the joy I'd get from being a part of elite social circles or being rich/famous; then, I thought about the joy of simply being outside for the rest of my life, or as long as I'm physically able to. And I realized I got a lot more joy from the experience/idea of the latter. That was kind of all I needed to get back on track on my goals. Every now and then, I _do_ consider straying from this path; it always seems like the "good things" or the "ambitious things" are hidden in the upper echelons, and _that_ is what I should be chasing. If I'm not, it feels like I'm not doing all I can. But what a darn sad & pointless & depressing way to live! I remember it whenever I simply look outside.

Books-wise, currently, I'm reading _Exhalation_ by Ted Chiang; I'm almost done, and I've been having a blast! I've particularly liked the entropy story... there were some beautiful lines in there that I have highlighted on my Kindle. I strongly believe in learning and making things for the sake of learning and making things, and the short story resonated lots with that. After I finish _Exhalation_, I'll probably write some more thoughts on it in here alongside my favorite quotes; then, it's on to _What I Talk About When I Talk About Running_ by Murakami, which I poached as a rec from [Lilian Weng's site.](https://lilianweng.github.io/) After that, I really feel like I'm missing out on Steinbeck, so I'll read East of Eden, then probably Grapes of Wrath. One book at a time, though!

Anyway, that's enough rambling...

### What problems have I encountered? What have I learned?
Those darn ants in Silksong are a pain, so I should find upgrades somewhere. Also, I should probably stop typing these posts in an IDE and move to some other platform, but I'm honestly lazy, and there's something glamorous about unglamorous methods sometimes.
