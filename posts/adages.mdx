# the curse of adage


You know what I hate?

I hate living through something--some conflict--and coming out of it alive, then realizing, “I should have listened to that old adage.” Because it’s just useless self-bashing. Sometimes, I entertain the notion of holding an arsenal of adages. If a conflict crops up--boom! I could smack an adage on the situation and live it. 

But of course, this vision contains something humans on planet Earth with real human lives lack: the gift of foresight.

If it was that easy to identify one’s current situation with an adage _while it was happening_, I’d think I’d be a lot better at it after 18 years of brute-forcing situations that could probably be boiled down into an adage. But… unfortunately, it simply isn’t, and I’m still just as bad at it as I was 18 years ago. Sure, maybe I now have an arsenal of experience that helps me navigate situations, but my actual skill of recovering from an _unseen_ experience is still just as bad as it was when I was born. And although people might train to _appear_ as they get better at this skill, actual progress is.. basically impossible. Not to say that it’s all futile, of course; training will result in you tackling problems you see better, because you’ll generalize, and all problems can be boiled down as different combinations of other problems. But if I teach you nothing but making fried rice from years 1 to 30, then suddenly ask you to interpret Dostoevsky, you’ll be no better at it at 30 than you were at 1. 

What’s the point of this? Well, human lives are, fundamentally, not that different. We have shared experiences, thoughts, instincts--our genetic blueprints are 99% the same. So when I say I fall for the fallacy of confirmation bias in this way, I’m sure others have fallen for it, too. After I live a situation, using the gift of hindsight, I’m able to boil it down into an adage; once I understand the situation and the adage, I think, _oh, if only I had fit the adage to my situation a bit earlier. Maybe then I could have avoided this undesirable outcome_. But it’s literally impossible. Even this can be boiled into another adage: _experience is the best teacher_. It’s because only through hindsight--which, in turn, only comes through experience--can one actually learn from a situation and avoid similar ones in the future.

It’s why it really grates my ears when someone gets angry at themself for not doing something. Because it’s like, we’ve all been there. I, and you, have been there _way too many times_. But it’s only your confirmation bias that makes you think you had any other ability but to not do that thing you are so mad at yourself for. 

Obviously, this isn’t an excuse for someone to go ballistic, make heinous mistakes, and say experience is the best teacher. No, that’s not it, because you’re not making the best possible decision _given the information_ that you currently know. I’m saying that hindsight often glosses over the latter part of that statement--the vital conditional. And I feel like those who often try their best forget that conditional, myself included.

There’s this Instagram reel of some Japanese guy yelling at people for complaining about going to the beach and just missing the sunset, or for not chasing something that they wanted (I know someone’s going to recall the reel because there were a lot of likes on that thing). I can’t help but reinforce the idea in my core, and it makes this whole complaining with hindsight thing super grating on me. I wish people could show up for themselves a bit more by quitting the self-hate and instead working towards betterment with hindsight, myself included*. To say that a bit differently, rather than using hindsight as a weapon for self-harm, use it as a tool to better yourself.**



_*I’ve been repeating “myself included” or some form of it quite a bit, which brings me to a smaller idea. As Carl Jung said, people hate in others what they hate in themselves. I think simply appending this statement to my internal moral heuristic guideline helps bring a little more empathy and love to my life, and I encourage you to think about it and do the same._


_**Also, I know someone’s probably thinking they get better through self-hate. I don’t care; bettering yourself through self-hate is never actually bettering yourself, according to my probably-flawed-somewhere-just-not-here values._

_Author's note._ This isn't a self-improvement log, but something I was inspired to write after reading a few good memoirs and a 20 minute boiling-hot shower, like how much of my creative work is born. I think the most exciting thing in my life right now is that I might get to meet Michael Reeves irl! Tentatively. Also, I've still been thinking about other little hobbies--and also, bigger things--that I'm working towards. I've really been taking good care of my physical health recently, and pursuing all the things that make me happy is great for my mental health, too. I really think I'm on the eve of something wonderful, but I'm not letting the precipice stop me from basking in the wonderfulness.
